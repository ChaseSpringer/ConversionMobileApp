# The Conversion Mobile Application
The Conversion Mobile App project for the Methods and Tools course, CSCI 3308.

This app was written with Xcode to run on the iOS operating system. It's designed to offer formulae in a way that is easy to 
understand and find what you're looking for. The formulae are for converting numeric values, such as converting between feet and meters.
The app has all of the formulae stored on it and a calculator for convenient calculations.
