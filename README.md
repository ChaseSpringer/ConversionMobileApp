# The Conversion Mobile Application
The Conversion Mobile App project for the Methods and Tools course, CSCI 3308.

This app was written with Xcode to run on the iOS operating system. It's designed to offer formulae in a way that is easy to 
understand and find what you're looking for. The formulae are for converting numeric values, such as converting between feet and meters.
The app has all of the formulae stored on it and a calculator for convenient calculations.

The Conversion2.0 is the latest version of the application. The auto tests are all in the Conversion2.0 folder as well.
We have the formulae for the app stored in one folder. All pdf's for the project submission parts are in the main folder.

The docs can be built and run with the VVDocumenter in the Xcode IDE.
The code can easily be run, tested, and edited also in the Xcode IDE.
